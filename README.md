### URL: https://victorhadziristic.github.io/shoppies-deployment/

Features: Create Shareable Links, Search by Year, Save nominations via cookies, Slightly Cleaner UI.

Note: You may notice that this repo has only a few commits. I had completed this challenge in a separate angular project but ended up messing up my dependencies (Couldn't decide whether to host via Firebase or GitHub Pages, and ended up having a ton of un-used dependencies, so I moved my work over to a clean angular project)
